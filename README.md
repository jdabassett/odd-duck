## description

This is the lab for week 3 of Code Fellows 201d93.

This is a webpage to take in user votes for the next product Odd Duck Company would produce. 

## How it works

The main(index) page has the explaination and three randomly generated images of potential products. 

The user clicks one, their vote is recorded and three new products are rendered, without immediately repeating any one product.

After 25 votes the user is presented with a button to view a chart of their results on a separate page.
